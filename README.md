I'm a bits older then you  but yes I remember BO2K Cult Of The Dead Cow,
And also John Draper, also known as "Captain Crunch." 
Draper's first foray into phone phreaking was simple but effective. 
He discovered that he could make free long-distance calls by using a rubber toy whistle that he found in a box of Captain Crunch cereal. 
The whistle emitted a 2600 Hz tone, which was the same tone that AT&T used to indicate that a long-distance call was over. 
By blowing into the whistle, Draper could fool the phone company into thinking that his call had ended, thus allowing him to make free calls all over the world. 
Phreaking Was Born 

OK! ok! I'm Ways older.
